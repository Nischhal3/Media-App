# Node Artive
## A digital exhibition - A home for art lovers

Node Artive is where artists share their artworks and sentiment through art. Our desire is to connect artists and art enthusiasts to form a cultural context for how art is created, discovered, and shared. Â We help artists find their identity through self-expression and we believe that art is for everyone.
